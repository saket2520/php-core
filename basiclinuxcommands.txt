BASIC LINUX COMMANDS -

1) cd "path" - used for changing directory.
For example - We are at the root directory.
~ Enter the Desktop directory:
~ cd Desktop ~ Desktop

->Turn back by one directory:

~ Desktop cd ..
~
OR

~Desktop cd -
~

-> Move to the root directory.If u are a user it is home/user.

~Dir_name1/Dirname_2 cd ~
~

2) ls - lists all the non-hidden directories and files existing in the current directory.

-> ls -R - lists all the directories and subdirectories upto the file level in the current directory.

-> ls -a - lists hidden files as well.Hidden files need permissions granted to be accessible and have
           names starting with the period symbol ,i.e, .

-> ls -l - displays permissions allowed for the files in the current directory.

          for example -
          -rwxrw-r-- - This code can be decoded as:

           1. The first - indicates the we have selected a file.For a directory it would have been d.
           2. The owner can read(r), write(w) and execute(x) the current file.
           3. The user group can read, write but not execute the current file.
           4. The world can only read the file.

3) cat>"filename" -  creates a file in the current directory with name as "filename" and opens it in write mode.

-> cat "filename" - displays the content of the file.

-> cat "filename1" "filename2">"filename3" - combines the contents of filename1 and filename2 into filename3.


4) sudo - this command is append before any command to give the current user all the security privileges as the
          root user.

5) rm "filename" or path/filename - deletes a file.

-> rmdirc - deletes a directory.

6) history - Gives a list of all past commands typed in the current terminal session.

7) apt-get - command used to install and delete packages.

8) chmod - chmod stands for change mode command.It is used to grant/change access permissions of a file.

           for example -

           ~ ls -l

           ~ -rw-r--r--  1 sbhatnagar sbhatnagar     184 Jan  2 09:04  devop.txt

           ~ chmod u+x devop.txt|chmod g+w devop.txt

           ~ ls -l devop.txt

           ~ -rwxrw-r-- 1 sbhatnagar sbhatnagar 184 Jan  2 09:04 devop.txt


The symbolic representation of permission types is:

u - user/owner
g - user group
o - others/world
a - all

Permission manipulating operators -

+ : adds following permissions.
- : removes follwing permissions.
= : sets following permissions.

9) pipe(|) - It is used to run multiple commands at once by passing the filtered O/P of the one command to the successor command.

10) grep - used to search for a string in a file.The syntax of the grep command/filter is:

            grep [options] "pattern" filename

        for example -  cat error.php | grep -n abstract

11) find - find command provides the utility of walking through a file hierarchy.It can be used to seach files and directories on the basis 
           of name, creation date, modification date, permissions,etc.

           The syntax is:

           find [where to start searching from] [expression determines what to find][options][what to find]

for ex-
~ tree /home/sbhatnagar/Desktop/check
/home/sbhatnagar/Desktop/check
├── newfile.txt
└── test cases
~ find /home/sbhatnagar/Desktop/check/ -name newfile.txt
/home/sbhatnagar/Desktop/check/newfile.txt

12) tree - tree command generates a graphical representation of the file hierarchy in a directory specified.
           Needs to be installed with : sudo apt-get install tree.
for ex-
~ tree /home/sbhatnagar/Desktop/check
/home/sbhatnagar/Desktop/check
├── newfile.txt
└── test cases

13) mv - mv command can be used to implement two basic functions:
         i) rename a file from source to destination.
         ii) physically moves a file from source to different directory.

The syntax of mv command in linux is:

mv [options] source destination.

Possible values of source and destination are:

Source    |  Destination|  Action

file      |  file       | i)if dest. file exists,will overwrite and delete the source file. (rename with dest.filename)
                          ii) if dest. file does not exist,creates one and copies the content of source and delete source.(rename)

file      |  folder/dir |  cut & paste

folder/dir|  folder/dir |  cut & paste

14) chown - used to change the ownership of a filesystem object.By default the owner of a filesystem object is the one which created it.

    a) If we wish to change the user ownership of a filesystem object.The command is as:

          sudo chown "user_owner_name" filename

    b) If we wish to change the user ownership and group ownership as well of a filesystem object.The command is:

        sudo chown "user_owner_name:group_owner_name" filename

    c) If we wish to change only the group owner,use the command:

        sudo chgrp "group_name" filename

15) touch - This command is used to fulfill two purposes:

            i) update the timestamp of an existing file.

            ii) create an empty file that is perhaps required to exist for a process to continue.

16) groups - Lists all the groups the current user belongs to.

17) tar - this command is used to untar (unzip) files that are compressed using the tar or tar.gz compression format.

          The syntax is as:

          tar -C "destination_dir" -zxvf "source_tar_file"

          If the destination directory is current directory,then -C switch can be omitted.
